\usage{
glassTogglePanel(triggerId, show_when = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{triggerId}{The inputId of the button (glassButton)
that toggles this panel.}

\item{show_when}{Optional. A specific value (character/numeric)
that the input at `triggerId` must match to show the panel.
If NULL (default), it assumes `triggerId` is a counter
(odd = show, even = hide) (button triggers).}

\item{...}{Content to display inside the panel.}
}
\description{
A content panel that toggles visibility based on a button click (counter).
Unlike conditionalPanel, this supports CSS transitions (slide/fade).
}
\details{
MIGHT NEED FIX: Is it acting as a ghost element that appears when triggered,
or is it more of a wrapper that shows/hides its content? If it is the
latter, we need to fix it as it will reserve space even when hidden,
which is not ideal.
